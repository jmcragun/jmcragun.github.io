			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
				Hi, I'm Joshua Cragun. Currently I'm currently enrolled in the schools of computing and mathematics at the University of Utah. I'm a team player and I enjoy a being challenged and am always striving to improve. I value results and attention to detail. Whenever I've accomplished a task, I always ask myself, "How could I have done that better?", and I'm not afraid to give my opinion when it comes to those sorts of questions. I believe that my collaborative mindset and passion for mathematics and computer science will make me a great addition to your team.
