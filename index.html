			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
				Hi, I'm Joshua Cragun. I am currently enrolled in the schools of computing and mathematics at the University of Utah. I am a team player and I enjoy being challenged and am always striving to improve. I value results and attention to detail. Whenever I have accomplished a task, I always ask myself, "How could I have done that better?". The combination of my collaborative and open mindset with my passion for mathematics and computer science will make me a great addition to your team.
